        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>A super basic pasta recipe with ground italian sausage and red sauce.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        
        <ul>
            <li>1 box of penne</li>
            <li>A jar of your favorite red sauce</li>
            <li>1lb ground italian sausage</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Bring a full pot of heavily salted water to a boil. Add your
            pasta and cook until "al dente," or tender but a little firm and
            chewy when bitten. Drain your pasta using a strainer.</li>
            <li>While your water comes to a boil and your pasta cooks, heat
            a medium saucepan on medium high, and add your sausage, breaking
            it up as it cooks.</li>
            <li>Once the sausage is fully cooked, add a jar of red sauce to 
            your saucepan, and simmer for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>Return your pasta to the pot, add your sauce, stir, serve, and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
