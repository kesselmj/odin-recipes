        <ol class="steplist">
            <li>Measure out 3/4 cup of water, add to a saucepan, 
            and bring to a boil.</li>
            <li>As the water comes to a boil, put the rice in a
            wire mesh strainer, and rinse off the starch under
            cold water. Rinse rice until water comes out of the 
            strainer mostly clear.</li>
            <li>Add rice to boiling water, reduce to a simmer. 
            Remove from heat when no steam visibly escapes from the saucepan.</li>
            <li>Heat a small skillet over medium low. Add sesame seeds. 
            Shuffle seeds around in pan occasionally. Remove from heat when 
            seeds are lightly toasted.</li>
            <li>Peel the skin off the ginger root using a vegetable
            peeler. Separate and peel the garlic cloves.</li>
            <li>Finely mince the peeled ginger root and garlic;
            slice the green onion into thin slices.</li>
            <li>Add 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup soy sauce, and the 
            minced garlic and ginger to a mixing bowl. Whisk to 
            combine, then add black pepper and crushed red pepper 
            to taste.</li>
            <li>Heat a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat.
            Add ground beef to pan. Slowly break up the beef as it cooks.</li>
            <li>Once beef is mostly browned, reduce heat to medium, and 
            add the soy sauce mixture. Cook with soy sauce mixture until sauce 
            thickens and all the beef is coated.</li>
            <li>Remove beef from heat. Add toasted sesame seeds and chopped green
            onion. Serve beef over rice and enjoy.</li>
